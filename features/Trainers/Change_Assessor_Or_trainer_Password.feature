Feature:
  As a user,
  I want to be able to change my password,
  so that I can ensure my account security and continued access to the system.

  Background:
     Given that I have licence.ndors.org.uk page opened
     When I logged into the Licence Portal
     Then My Profile page every user will have 2 collapsible sections
     And The first section will be labelled 'Change Password' which will be collapsed by default.
     And The other section will be labelled 'Profile details' and it will be expand by default.
